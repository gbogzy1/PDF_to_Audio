# PDF_to_Audio

Sometimes I get too busy to read. Or might be commuting/driving and want to read a book but unable to do so. 
So, i decided to code myself a PDF to Audio program which allows me to convert any pdf text to audio.

Now, I can listen to all my books about artifical intelligence :). You can too by following and forking my code.
